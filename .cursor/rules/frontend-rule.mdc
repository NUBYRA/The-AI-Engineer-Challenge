### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- Make sure to provide consistent color theming using pastel colors. 
- Make sure to keep a small set of colors for theming, don't go overbaord in choosing too many colors and varaition in colors. 
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.
